Title:&nbsp; E-functions and Geometry.

Abstract:&nbsp; Siegel introduced the notion of E-function in a landmark 1929 paper with the goal of generalising the Hermite-Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem on the transcendence of the values of the exponential function at algebraic numbers. E-functions are power series with algebraic coefficients that are solutions of a linear differential equation and satisfy some growth conditions of arithmetic nature. Besides the exponential function, examples include Bessel functions and a rich family of hypergeometric series. I will explain how such functions arise from geometry in the form of "exponential period functions", and why it might seem reasonable, in the light of other conjectures, to expect that all E-functions are of this kind.

Title:&nbsp; Nonuniqueness of Calabi-Yau metrics with maximal volume growth

Abstract:&nbsp; Generalizing Sékelyhidi's construction, we construct a new family of Calabi-Yau metrics on **C**<sup>3</sup> with maximal volume growth, whose tangent cone at infinity is given by the singular cone **C** x A<sub>2</sub>, where A<sub>2</sub> is the two dimensional A2 singularity equipped with the flat cone metric. We then show that these metrics are distinct in the sense that they are not related by an isometry and a scaling. Finally, we discuss a refined version of a conjecture of Székelyhidi about the classification of such metrics.

Title:&nbsp; Free boundary minimal surfaces in the unit ball and the *first* Steklov eigenvalue

Abstract:&nbsp; Fraser and Schoen have uncovered a beautiful relationship between free boundary minimal surfaces in the unit ball and the Steklov problem: the coordinate functions of such surfaces are Steklov eigenfunctions with eigenvalue 1, and, on the other hand, the eigenfunctions for extremal metrics for the Steklov problem provide embeddings of free boundary minimal surfaces. The Fraser--Li conjecture states that not only are the coordinate functions Steklov eigenfunctions with eigenvalue 1, this eigenvalue is also the smallest non-zero one.

In this talk, I will discuss the history of the problem, the relation with minimal surfaces in the sphere, and explain an elementary proof of special cases of the Fraser--Li conjecture assuming some additional symmetries.
